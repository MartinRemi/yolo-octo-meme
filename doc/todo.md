List of things to do on the code:

In geometry : 
- Add functions to detect collisions between shapes in Collisions.js
- Refactor shapes to make them use Vector2 instead of double

In physics/core :
- Remake the force system. (!)
- Maybe we can merge the physics and core folders

In inputs :
- Make function to manage global events not only on objects

In math :
- Add some fonctions to manipulate transformations more easily
- Make the name of functions coherent
