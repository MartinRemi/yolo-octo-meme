## Description : 
This 2D web game engine is not meant to overperform its competitors.
This project is led by three students in computing at INSA, Lyon, France for learning purposes.

## Some of its features :
	* I/O :
		- Basic functions to handle Input events : keyboard and eventually touchscreen events
		- Sound management
	* Display
		- Basic geometric shapes
		- Curves
		- Text
	* Mathematics :
		- Features to handle matrix (i.e. the gameboard)
	* Physics :
		- collision
		- acceleration
	* Network :
		- Save game state
		- Function to set up multiplayer games
	* Scripts :
		- LUA
		- or our own scripting language
